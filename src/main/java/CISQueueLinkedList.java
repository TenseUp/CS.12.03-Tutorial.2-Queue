public class CISQueueLinkedList {

    // Inner Node class.
    // A Node can be created to hold any type of data.
    // A Node's constructor will initialise the data property of the Node and set the Node's next pointer to null.

    // CISQueueLinkedList will contain three properties:
    // 1. head
    // 2. tail
    // 3. size

    // CISQueueLinkedList's constructor will initialise a new Node and set this Node to be the head and tail.

    // CISQueueLinkedList will have a size method that returns the number of elements in the Queue.

    // CISQueueLinkedList will have an isEmpty method that returns whether the Queue is empty.

    // CISQueueLinkedList will have an enqueue method that enqueues a Node to the end of the Queue.

    // CISQueueLinkedList will have a dequeue method that polls a Node from the front of the Queue.

    // CISQueueLinkedList will have a contains method that checks to see if a Node in the Queue contains certain data.

    // CISQueueLinkedList will have a toString method that returns a String representation of the Queue.
    // The format of the String returned will be, for example:
    // 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null
    // Where the head reference points to 1 and the tail reference points to 3.
